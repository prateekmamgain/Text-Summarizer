      "It could be the hunger or maybe the desire to want more, to go beyond and unravel the limitations, or maybe something like pure greed\n",
      "Humans have never stopped and always keep evolving when it comes to intelligence and this is what makes them the supreme.Intelligence calls out for supremacy and so, what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds, to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves? Artificial Intelligence came as a revolution, havoc when it first came to the light\n",
      "The concept of making machines does work on their own, like granting machines â€“The Intelligence.The idea of making machines work like humans came back in the 19s\n",
      "Back then people didnâ€™t believe in such a thing as making a non-living thing work, think, and carry tasks on its own, not to mention, to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills\n",

Equipment?\\xa0 Something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision?

Will the machines really surpass humans? Will, the creation take over the creator?No matter how fearful the future with AI may seem, in reality, it is not that scary\n",
